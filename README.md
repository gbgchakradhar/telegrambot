A telegram bot, created using python to make the series F.R.I.E.N.D.S, available to download easily.

## Create a bot ##

<p>The first step is to create a bot from the BotFather bot, which is a official telegram bot by Telegram. Follow the below steps to create a bot, name the bot, give a usermane for the bot, change the privacy setting for the bot. 

Bot commands can also be managed from the BotFather bot manager bot itself. But for our flexibility we use python, where we can even establish a database connection for user data.</p>

</p>

Use the command `/newbot` to start creating a new bot. Give the bot, a name, user name and the bot will give an API key.

</p>

Select the bot and disable the privacy settings. By default, the privacy settings are enabled. If the privacy is enabled, then bot cannot access the messages when it is added to a channel, unless the bot is mentioned by the user.


The bot is now created and can be accessable by the users from anywhere. But we didn't train the bot to reply to the commands. For this, we can directly train it from the BotFather itself, which is less efficient than training with any programming language.

Follow the code form `./src/bot.py` file to understand how the telegram api's, get and post command works.
